- **AUX1 Sprinting**: Prefer a button? Hold the AUX1 key to sprint, or use both methods.
- **Smooth Sprinting**: Sprinting feels natural and doesn't randomly stop.
- **Sprint Underwater**: Move faster while swimming underwater.
- **Customizable**: Change sprint speed, jump boost, and more in the settings.

- **Stamina & Hunger Mod Support**: Works with popular mods like stamina, hunger_ng, and hbhunger.

### **How it Works**

- **To sprint:** Just double-tap the forward key (usually "W") or hold the AUX1 key (if enabled).
- **Fatigue Bar:** If you don't have a hunger or stamina mod, you'll see a fatigue bar. Rest to recover stamina.
- **Customization:** Open your settings to adjust how sprinting works.
- **Water Sprinting:** Sprint underwater for faster swimming.
- **Bed Use:** Stop sprinting before using beds.

If you have a hunger or stamina mod, this mod will use that system. If not, it uses its own simple fatigue bar. Only one hunger or stamina mod should be active at a time.
